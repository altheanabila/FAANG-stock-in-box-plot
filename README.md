# FAANG-stock-in-box-plot

I try to visualize the closing price of FAANG stock, using Python libraries, such as : pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn, box plot could be created and with inherent descritive statistics.

1. First of all, download daily historical data from yahoo finance from each FAANG stock for 2 years, from 1 January 2018-31 December 2020. And sort the data into 1 file excel.

2. read the excel data in by converting in pandaframes:

3. Define df

4. Using the command: `import plotly.express as px` you can see the descriptive analytics of each stock in that looks user friendly
